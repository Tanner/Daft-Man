DaftMan
========
A fork of Ryan Ashcraft's DaftMan rewritten in Objective-C.

Ryan's [DaftMan on GitHub](http://github.com/ryanashcraft/DaftMan) is slightly modified (foe's have AI), but is otherwise the same. This does not have AI (yet).

### Idea
The goal of the game is to move the bro around to collect the number of rupees for each level while avoiding fire and the evil foes.

You gain rupees by blowing up the bricks using bombs.

#### Controls
Arrow keys to move around. Space for bomb dropping.
